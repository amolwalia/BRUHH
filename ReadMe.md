## AHA Moments
1. I finally opened and used *Terminal* on my computer
2. I learned about command line interface and it turns out it's not complicated but logical
3. I learned what Semantic Versioning meant

## Things Still Unlcear
1. how to navigate through github
2. how to actually code

## One word that I am feeling
Confused but calm (idek how that even works) ðŸ˜•
